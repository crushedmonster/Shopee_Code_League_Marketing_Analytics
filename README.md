#### Background Information:
The aim of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a user opens the emails sent by Shopee.

Sending emails is one of the marketing channels Shopee uses to reach out to our users. Being able to predict whether a user opens an email allows Shopee to forecast and evaluate the performance of future marketing campaigns before launch. This is because when a user opens an email, the probability of the user knowing the campaign increases and this in turn increases the probability of the user making a checkout during the campaign period. Therefore, with the predicted open rates, Shopee can better develop, strategize and implement future marketing campaigns.


#### Task:
We provide you with data related to marketing emails (Electronic Direct Mail) that were sent to Shopee users over a certain period. It contains information about

* User-specific information
* Email nature
* Users’ engagement on the platform
* User’s reaction to the email, including whether users opened the email

Based on the data provided, you must predict whether each user will open an email sent to him/her.
